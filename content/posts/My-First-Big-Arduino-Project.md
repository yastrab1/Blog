For the past few years, I have been playing a bit with the microcomputer Arduino.
In fact, I have actually learned how to code using the simplified Arduino C language.
And this year, I saw a great opportunity to make a bigger projects. Every year in 
our school, we have to pick a topic that we make a project from. We have a whole year
to finish the projects, and it lead to some great ideas being brought to light. 

This year, me and 2 of my friends saw a great opportunity to learn something about
these kinds of projects, and to also solve a problem that my friend had for a long time.
