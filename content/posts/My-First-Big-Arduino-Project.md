For the past few years, I have been playing a bit with the microcomputer Arduino.
In fact, I have actually learned how to code using the simplified Arduino C language.
And this year, I saw a great opportunity to make a bigger projects. Every year in 
our school, we have to pick a topic that we make a project from. We have a whole year
to finish the projects, and it leads to some great ideas being brought to light. 

This year, me and 2 of my friends saw a great opportunity to learn something about
these kinds of projects, and to also solve a problem that my friend had for a long time.
## The problem
Imagine you have a lot of lizards at home (my friend does!), and you travel somewhere on the holiday. 
How will the lizards be fed? Well, we had the idea of an automatic farm for insects that would feed the lizard.
Of course, we knew this is a huge project, but decided to do it anyway, since for the yearly projects, there is 
no guarantee we actually finish the project, and it seemed like a cool idea.
