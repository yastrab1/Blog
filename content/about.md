Hi! My name is Lukas and I am a young enthusiastic software developer. I like to spend a lot of my time experimenting with prototype projects, so is this blog.

I learned to code when I was 6, and since then, I have done few cool things. For example, my submissions in our schools game jam, Å pongia [(our team page)](https://imoblinihrosici.000webhostapp.com/)

I had an internship in [Mindfloat](https://www.mindfloat.com/) where I learned how software is done in corporations.

Other than coding, I also like maths and physics, with several achievements in math and physics competitions [link](achievements.md)
